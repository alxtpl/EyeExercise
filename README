# EyeExercise

## Description

EyeExercise is an interactive web experiment that demonstrates the capability of CSS and JavaScript to create engaging user experiences. This project features a pair of eyes that follow the user's mouse cursor, creating a visually captivating effect on the screen.

## How to Run

To experience EyeExercise, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. As you move your mouse cursor across the screen, the eyes will follow its movement, giving the illusion of being watched.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- Enhance eye movement animations for a more realistic effect.
- Add additional elements to create a complete character or scene.
- Implement user settings to customize eye color, size, or behavior.
- Optimize code for better performance and compatibility across browsers.
